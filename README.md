# UDACITY-MLND
This repository contains my completed project submissions for the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree program

The key projects are:
1. Boston Houssing prices (focused on Model Evaluation and Validation, Data preprocessing)
2. Charity Donor identification (implementing Supervised Learning)
3. Creating Customer Segments for products (exploring Unsupervised Learning)
4. Smartcab simulation (using Reinforcement Learning)
5. Image Recognition (using Deep Learning - CNNs)

Currently working on the capstone project of a robot navigating a maze (all virtual)
